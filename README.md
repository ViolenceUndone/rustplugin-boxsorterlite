Box sorter makes housekeeping easier in multiple ways

* An intuitive interface that is visible while looting boxes allowing players to select its category. 
* The selected category is displayed both by changing the skin of the box and by displaying the category while looting.

*Food is always default category for refrigerators and independent of its skin*
